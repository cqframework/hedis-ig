<h2>
	<span>Cervical Cancer Screening (CMS124)</span>
</h2>

<h3>Measure Description</h3><p>Percentage of women 21-64 years of age who were screened for cervical cancer using either of the following criteria:</p>
	<ul><li> Women age 21-64 who had cervical cytology performed every 3 years</li>
	<li>Women age 30-64 who had cervical cytology/human papillomavirus (HPV) co-testing performed every 5 years</li></ul>
<h3>Initial Population</h3><p>Women 23-64 years of age with a visit during the measurement period</p>
<h3>Denominator Statement</h3><p>Equals Initial Population</p>
<h3>Denominator Exclusions</h3><p>Women who had a hysterectomy with no residual cervix. Exclude patients who were in hospice care during the measurement year.</p>
<h3>Numerator Statement</h3>
<p>Women with one or more screenings for cervical cancer. Appropriate screenings are defined by any one of the following criteria:</p>
	<ul><li>Cervical cytology performed during the measurement period or the two years prior to the measurement period for women who are at least 21 years old at the time of the test</li>
	<li>Cervical cytology/human papillomavirus (HPV) co-testing performed during the measurement period or the four years prior to the measurement period for women who are at least 30 years old at the time of the test</li></ul>
<h3>Numerator Exclusions</h3><p> Not Applicable</p>
<h3>Denominator Exception</h3><p> None</p>

<h3>Measure Scoring</h3><p> Proportion</p>
<h3>Measure Type</h3><p> Process</p>
<h3>Improvement Notation</h3><p> Higher score indicates better quality</p>
<h3>Guidance</h3><p> To ensure the measure is only looking for a cervical cytology test only after a woman turns 21 years of age, the youngest age in the initial population is 23.

Patient self-report for procedures as well as diagnostic studies should be recorded in 'Procedure, Performed' template or 'Diagnostic Study, Performed' template in QRDA-1. Patient self-report is not allowed for laboratory tests.

Include only cytology and HPV "co-testing"; in co-testing, both cytology and HPV tests are performed (i.e., the samples are collected and both tests are ordered, regardless of the cytology result) on the same date of service. Do not include reflex testing. In addition, if the medical record indicates the HPV test was performed only after determining the cytology result, this is considered reflex testing and does not meet criteria for the measure.

<h3> Narrative </h3>
<p>Patient ID: 6520
Patient name is Terry Harvey Waller (THW). She is in the age range of 52 to 81 years old. Birthdate being 1936-08-16. Gender is female.  Because of this information the Initial population will result in “True” because the age of the patient is between 24 and 64. The Denominator will be “True” because the Initial population is true. The Numerator is not applicable for this measure. The Denominator Exclusion will result in "True" because code http://www.ama-assn.org/go/cpt 58150
