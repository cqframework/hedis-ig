## 1 HEDISÂ® Implementation Guide
{: #hedis-implementation-guide}

NCQA's Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS) is a tool used by more than 90 percent of America's 
health plans to measure performance on important dimensions of care and service. Altogether, HEDIS consists of 81 
measures across 5 domains of care. Because so many plans collect HEDIS data, and because the measures are so 
specifically defined, HEDIS makes it possible to compare the performance of health plans on an "apples-to-apples" basis.

Modern value-based care involves calculating payer-relation quality measures. This calculation relies on access to 
patient information, which is (for this guide) represented using 
[Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources]({{site.data.fhir.path}}) (FHIR). FHIR's secure, RESTful, standards-based 
services for accessing patient information streamlines this process. By combining FHIR with shareable knowledge 
artifacts, we significantly reduce the amount of engineering effort required to implement and maintain useful HEDIS 
quality measure calculations for payers. Healthcare providers also experience reduced effort, as responding to quality 
reporting requests is greatly simplified with this approach.

### 1.1 Overview
{: #overview}

The [Clinical Reasoning module]({{site.data.fhir.path}}clinicalreasoning-module.html) of the FHIR specification defines 
resources and operations to support decision support and quality measurement. In particular, FHIR's 
[Quality Reporting]({{site.data.fhir.path}}cqif/cqif-quality-reporting.html) section describes 
[Measure]({{site.data.fhir.path}}measure.html) and [MeasureReport]({{site.data.fhir.path}}measurereport.html) resources, 
which define quality measures and reporting measurement results, including the patient information involved in 
performing the calculations.

### 1.2 How To Read This Guide
{: #how-to-read-this-guide}

This guide is divided into several pages which are listed at the top of each page in the menu bar:

-  **[Home](index.html)**: The home page provides an overview and list of HEDIS measures covered in this guide
-  **[Libraries](libraries.html)**: The libraries page provides a list of FHIR Library resources that contain the 
metadata and CQL logic for the HEDIS measures covered in this guide 
-  **[Measures](measures.html)**: The measures page provides a list of FHIR Measure resources that contain the 
metadata and provide the structured computable definitions for the HEDIS measures covered in this guide 
-  **[Profiles](profiles.html)**: The profiles page provides a list of FHIR profiles that define the data requirements,
constraints and extensions used in the HEDIS measures covered in this guide
-  **[Terminologies](terminologies.html)**: The terminologies page provides a list of FHIR ValueSet resources that 
define the coded, structured data used by the FHIR profiles defined in this guide
-  **[Documentation](documentation.html)**: The documentation page provides guidance (from a technical perspective) for 
the implementation and evaluation of the artifacts outlined in this guide
-  **[Downloads](downloads.html)**: This page provides links to downloadable artifacts for implementations
