## 4 Profiles
{: #profiles}

In order to support HEDIS measures expressed with CQL, we've extended a number of QI Core FHIR profiles and tightened 
their constraints where needed. The below profiles are not meant to provide exhaustive coverage of every possible 
measure; just those needed to support our sample set.

<table class="list">
	<thead>
		<tr>
			<th>Profiles</th><th>Description</th>
		</tr>
	</thead>
	<tbody>
		{% include table-profiles.xhtml %}
	</tbody>
